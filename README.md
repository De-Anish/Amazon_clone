## Introduction

The Amazon Clone project is a comprehensive web application that closely mimics the layout, design, and functionality of Amazon. The application is divided into two main parts: the frontend and the backend. The frontend is built using React, while the backend utilizes Node.js and Express for handling server-side logic and API requests. MongoDB is used as the database to store product information, user details, and orders.

The primary purpose of this project is to serve as a learning resource for developers looking to enhance their full-stack development skills. It demonstrates the implementation of various features commonly found in e-commerce applications and can be used as a foundation to build similar projects.

## Features

- User authentication and authorization (signup, login, logout).
- Browsing products by category.
- Product search functionality.
- Detailed product pages with product information and customer reviews.
- Shopping cart management (add, update, remove items).
- Checkout process with address selection and payment integration.
- Order history for users to track their past purchases.
- Admin panel for managing products, categories, and user orders.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS

## Installation

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/amazon-clone.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd amazon-clone`
3. Install frontend dependencies: `cd frontend && npm install`
4. Install backend dependencies: `cd ../backend && npm install`
5. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the necessary environment variables (MongoDB connection string, Stripe API key, etc.).
6. Seed the database with sample data (optional): `node seeder.js` (in the `backend` directory).
7. Run the development server: `cd ../frontend && npm start` (frontend) and `cd ../backend && npm start` (backend).

## Usage

After following the installation steps, you can access the application by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. You can register as a new user, browse products, add items to your cart, and proceed through the checkout process.

Please note that the payment functionality is integrated with Stripe's test mode, so no real transactions will occur.
